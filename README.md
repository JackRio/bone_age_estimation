# Bone Age Estimation in Left Hand Radiographs
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for bone age estimation using left hand radiographs. The primary goal is to build a proof of concept that showcases the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) in assisting radiologists with this task. The project is a collaborative effort between a radiologist from Mexico and *Hospital*.

## Dataset
The model will be trained on a publicly available dataset provided by the RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Challenge (2017). This dataset consists of a diverse range of X-ray images of pediatric patients along with their corresponding bone age labels. It serves as a comprehensive resource for training and evaluating the proposed deep learning model.

Additionally, the project aims to evaluate the model's performance on a private dataset obtained from a hospital. This evaluation will help assess the model's real-world applicability and provide insights into its effectiveness when applied to different data sources.

## Project Scope and Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately estimate the bone age of pediatric patients. By leveraging the power of AI, the model intends to assist radiologists by automating and augmenting their bone age assessment process. This collaboration seeks to combine the expertise of a radiologist with the technical skills of an AI student to create a robust and reliable tool.

It is important to note that this project is solely for research purposes and will not be utilized in any commercial aspect. The code may contain re-implementations of existing models, but proper references will be provided to acknowledge the original work.

## Expected Deliverables
- A trained deep learning model capable of estimating bone age from X-ray images.
- A comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance on both public and private datasets.
- Documentation detailing the model architecture, training procedure, and evaluation results.
- Code repository containing the source code, dataset processing scripts, and model implementation.
- Proper attribution and references to any external code or models used in the project.
- By developing and presenting this proof of concept, the project aims to demonstrate the potential of AI in assisting radiologists and advancing medical imaging practices for bone age estimation.
